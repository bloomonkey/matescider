# Welcome to Mates Cider Company
## Handcrafted Local Cider

Mates Cider Company was founded by Roger Hesten and Dave Harrison in 2010 following years of successful hand crafted cider making for pleasure.

Mates Cider is based in Malmesbury, North Wiltshire on the southern edge of the Cotswolds.
Ideally placed between the main traditional west country cider making areas of Hereford and Somerset.
