# Welcome to Mates Cider Company
## Handcrafted Local Cider

### Who we are

Mates Cider Company was founded by Roger Hesten and Dave Harrison in 2010 following years of successful hand crafted cider making for pleasure.

### What we do

We hand pick a blend of genuine unsprayed west country cider apples and perry pears, then employ traditional techniques to press the juice.
Finally we allow a lengthy maturation period in order to let the full flavours develop, resulting in our authentic delicious finished products.

### Where we do it

Mates Cider is based near Malmesbury, North Wiltshire on the southern edge of the Cotswolds.
Ideally placed between the main traditional west country cider making areas of Hereford and Somerset.
